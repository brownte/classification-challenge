# Module 13 Challenge - Spam Detection Project

This project is designed to compare the performance of two machine learning models—Logistic Regression and Random Forest Classifier—in detecting spam emails using a dataset of email features.

## Overview

The goal of this project is to build and evaluate two different machine learning models to classify emails as spam or legitimate. The models used in this project are:
- **Logistic Regression**: A linear model that is easy to interpret but may not perform well on complex datasets.
- **Random Forest Classifier**: An ensemble learning method that combines multiple decision trees and is effective at capturing non-linear relationships.

## Models Compared

### Logistic Regression

- A simple linear model that is often used for binary classification tasks.
- Assumes a linear decision boundary between classes.

### Random Forest Classifier

- An ensemble model consisting of multiple decision trees.
- Capable of capturing complex, non-linear patterns in the data.

## Results

The results of the model comparison are as follows:

- **Logistic Regression Model:**
  - Training Accuracy: 92.60%
  - Testing Accuracy: 92.35%

- **Random Forest Classifier Model:**
  - Training Accuracy: 99.97%
  - Testing Accuracy: 95.56%


## Conclusion

The Random Forest Classifier demonstrated superior performance in detecting spam emails compared to the Logistic Regression model. This outcome aligns with the initial prediction and reinforces the effectiveness of ensemble learning methods for tasks with complex and high-dimensional data.
